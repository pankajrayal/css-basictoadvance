    <p class="page-content">Despite the shutdown of sport having occurred at the end of the cricket season and Australia
        having been
        relatively successful in containing the pandemic, CA in early June forecast a drop in revenue of nearly 50% for
        the 2020-21 season. </p>
    <p class="page-content">The knock-on effect of this drop on grants to the powerful state bodies and player salaries
        triggered major
        discontent in the game and resulted in the ousting of Roberts last month.</p>
    <p class="page-content">“The parties have agreed to postpone the Australian Cricket Revenue projection until such
        time they are better
        able to assess the financial impact of the pandemic and calculate a clear projection for the year ahead,” the
        governing body said.</p>
